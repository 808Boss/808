Still nothing has happend. Therefore i'm doing a take-over! Lets join forces and get this coin back to life! 
The first stage will be a brainstorm. Because, we need to decide what our focus and goal is going to be!

We are here because we just like the crypto's and blockchain. And, 808coin is our podium. We are here because we can't stand it to see a coin like 808 dying.
